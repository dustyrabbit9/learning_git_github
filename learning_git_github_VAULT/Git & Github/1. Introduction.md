## What is Git?

* Git is essentially a really epic save button for your files and directories.
* It is a version control system.
* It keeps a historical record of each save.
* An essential skill for modern devs.

___

### Version Control 
* Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time.
* Version control allows you to recall specific versions later.
* Will allow you to revert to a previous state when required.

* **Centralized version control systems** is when these systems have a single server that contains all the versioned files.

* In **Distributed version control systems** such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs, clients don't just check out the latest snapshot of the files, rather fully mirror the the repository, including its full history.
* Incase any server dies, each client system collaborating will save the data from being lost and back it up to the main server.
