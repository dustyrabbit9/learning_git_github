## Git 
- Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem.
- In Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.
- Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.
- Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate
- Git doesn’t need to go out to the server to get the history and display it for you — it simply reads it directly from your local database.
- When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only _add_ data to the Git database.
- You can commit to your local copy.

- Everything in Git is **checksummed** before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum. This means it’s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it.

## The Three States
The main thing to remember about Git is that it has three main states that your files can reside in:
1. **modified**: Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
3. **staged**: Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.
4. **commited**: Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.

- The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project. These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.

- The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit. Its technical name in Git parlance is the “index”, but the phrase “staging area” works just as well.

- The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project. This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you _clone_ a repository from another computer.


The basic Git workflow goes something like this:
1. You modify files in your working tree.    
2.  You selectively stage just those changes you want to be part of your next commit, which adds _only_ those changes to the staging area.    
3.  You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.
