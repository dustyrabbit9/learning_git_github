## Introduction
In this section, Git Commands will be discussed. These commands will be used to manage your projects and upload your work onto GitHub. We refer to these commands as the **basic Git workflow**.

___

Before you continue to use Git on the command line to commit and push to the repository, refer to this link to learn how to set up an SSH key with your Terminal: https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations/lessons/setting-up-git

Check Git Version:
`git --version`

Set your local default git branch to `main`:
`git config --global init.defaultBranch main`

**Creating a repository**
1. Use the **+** button on GitHub to create a new repository, give it a name and description.
2. Once within your repository, use the **Code** button and copy the SSH link to get the clone URL to clone the repository onto your local machine.
3. On your machine within a directory where you want to make the repo using `mkdir` 
4. Now you must clone your repository from GitHub onto your computer using `git clone git@github.com:USER-NAME/REPOSITORY-NAME.git` (Make sure it is SSH)

## Git Workflow
- `git status` This command will return the status of the working directory and the staging area.
- `git add <file>`: The git add command adds a change in the working directory to the staging area.
- `git commit -m "First Commit"`: The git commit command captures a snapshot of the project's currently staged changes.
- `git push`: The git push command will upload the local repository to the GitHub repository, updating the GitHub repository.
- `git log`: The git log command shows a list of all the commits made to a repository.
